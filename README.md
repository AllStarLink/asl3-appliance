# ASL3 Appliance
This repo and its .deb output contains only the elements for ASL3 that
are used for the "turnkey" appliances - Pis as well as "appliance" Debian 12
installs. In general, any issues
with ASL3 should be filed at [ASL3](https://github.com/AllStarLink/ASL3)
or [app\_rpt](https://github.com/AllStarLink/app_rpt). If the issue is related
to the appliance package, it will be moved here as approprite.

Only open an issue with this repository if you have been instructed
to do so by an ASL developer or the ASL Helpdesk.
